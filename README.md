# Sudoku Solver

This is a Sudoku Solver written in **C**.

I made this ~~to conquer the **world**!~~ because I wanted to train myself more
in the use of **C**. One of the objectives here, is to get **no** warnings when
compiling the project.

---

#### How to use this project:

1. Use `make` to **compile**.
2. `./sudoku example` **runs** the program using an example in this format:
```
0 0 0 2 0 0 0 6 3
3 0 0 0 0 5 4 0 1
0 0 1 0 0 3 9 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0
0 0 0 5 3 8 0 0 0
0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 6 3 0 0 5 0 0
5 0 3 7 0 0 0 0 8
4 7 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
```
There are 6 examples available and a base file for helping when writing your own
sudoku.
